Solution for Day 4 of Advent of Code 2017.

Problem: High-Entropy Passphrases

Part 1: Count the number of valid passphrases. Valid passphrases are those
that contain no duplicate words. Each word is separated by a space

Part 2: Count the number of valid passphrases, and this time, valid passphrases
are defined to be ones where there are no anagrams of each other in each line.

For more of what the above means, check out the examples used to test the
solution functions I've written.
