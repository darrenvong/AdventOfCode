Solution for Day 2 of Advent of Code 2017.

Problem: Corruption Checksum

Part 1: Find the sum of the range (i.e. difference between largest and smallest number)
of each row.

Part 2: Find the sum of the quotient from the pair of values on each row where one can evenly
divide the other.

For more of what the above means, check out the examples used to test the
solution functions I've written.
